            <h4>God of War II (2007)</h4>
            <p class="pogi2">Kratos doesn't last long in his new gig. One day, while he's off fighting with his former Spartan brothers in the city of Rhodes -- against the wishes of Athena and the rest of the gods -- a giant eagle appears out of nowhere and saps away his powers, animating the Colossus of Rhodes in the process.</p>
                
            <p class="pogi2">As the giant statue moves to attack, Zeus appears with a gift: the Blade of Olympus. In order to power the blades, however, Kratos must imbue them with the little that remains of his godly might. He does it and quickly bests the Colossus, only to discover that the whole thing was a trick.</p>
                
        <p class="pogi2">The eagle that started the whole mess was Zeus all along. He stripped away Kratos's power to teach him a lesson. But he also has an offer for the Spartan: Stay loyal to the gods from here on out and all will be forgiven. Kratos refuses. Angered, Zeus kills the short-lived god of war with his own blade and wipes out the entire Spartan army.</p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">Before he can land once again in the Underworld, Kratos is saved by Gaia, a Titan and one of the forebears of the gods of Olympus. She explains how, long ago, she raised a young Zeus who then betrayed the Titans because of the way his own father, a Titan named Cronos, had treated the gods of Olympus.</p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">Gaia has an offer for Kratos: Go find the Sisters of Fate, corporeal manifestations of destiny, and use their power to undo his own murder at the hands of Zeus and get revenge. He agrees, and sets out to find the Sisters, encountering a number of Titans along the way: Prometheus, Typhon, and Atlas.</p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">After freeing Prometheus from his endless torture, and earning the power of a Titan in the process, Kratos escapes from the clutches of Typhon. His journey then takes him to the island home of the Sisters, where he meets Atlas.</p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">The imprisoned Titan reveals that Kratos has again not been given the whole story: Gaia and her fellow Titans really just want revenge on Zeus because he defeated them. Atlas also reveals that Zeus is vulnerable to the Blade of Olympus.
        Kratos eventually reaches the Sisters' stronghold, where he learns that Zeus, after murdering the one-time god of war, destroyed Sparta. Worse, the Sisters not only refuse to help Kratos, they also try to change the past so he loses to Ares.</p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">They don't succeed and Kratos kills all three, gaining control of their Loom of Fate in the process. He uses the powerful artifact to return to the moment Zeus betrayed him. With his strength fully restored, Kratos attacks and nearly kills Zeus... until Athena intervenes. She gets between the two gods and impales herself on Kratos's blade.
        Athena has one major revelation to share before she dies, however: Kratos is actually the son of Zeus. The elder god attacked his child out of fear; a younger Zeus had overthrown his own father, Cronos, long ago. He was afraid Kratos would do the same to him.
        In his final act, Kratos travels back in time to the moment the Titans were defeated. He saves them all and brings them to the present. The game ends as Kratos and his new allies converge on Mount Olympus.
