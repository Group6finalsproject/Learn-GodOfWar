            <h4 class="ay3">Cory Barlog</h4>
            <p class="ay2"> Cory Barlog is a video game developer who is best known for his work on the God of War franchise for the SIE Santa Monica Studio. He previously worked on Backyard Wrestling: Don't Try This at Home and X-Men: Next Dimension.
     
              After joining Santa Monica, Barlog worked as the lead animator for God of War (2005), and was the game director for God of War II (2007), for which he won a BAFTA award for his writing work on the game. He then served as game director for God of War III (2010) for the first eight months of its development. Although not part of Sony at the time, he also helped in writing God of War: Ghost of Sparta (2010).
             
              After leaving Santa Monica, Cory worked as the cinematics director for Crystal Dinamics' Tomb Raider, but then returned to Santa Monica in 2013 to work as the creative director and story writer for God of War (2018), for which he won best game direction and overall game of the year at The Game Awards 2018 ceremony. </p>
              
              <h4 class="ay3">David Jaffe</h4>
              <p class="ay2">David Jaffe is a writer, rabbi and spiritual seeker. His first book, Changing the World from the Inside Out (Trumpeter, 2016), explores how to walk a holy path that integrates deep spiritual wisdom with the daily work of peacemaking and social change. David’s social consciousness was forged by the busing era and legal desegregation of late 60s and early 70s in New York as well as the growing openness about the Holocaust in the Jewish community. He has spent his entire adult life pursuing Jewish wisdom and working for reconciliation and social justice. This journey has taken him from his home in New York to the homeless shelters of San Francisco’s Tenderloin, to traditional Yeshiva in Jerusalem, to refugee camps of Central Africa and faith-rooted community organizing in Boston. During this time David served as the Director of Social Justice Programs at the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, as a founding board member of Avodah: The Jewish Service Corps and as the Spiritual Advisor at Gann Academy in Waltham, MA. David is the Founder and Principal of the Kirva Institute, where he teaches applied Jewish wisdom including Mussar and Tikkun Middot.
 
                David’s teaching, organizing, writing and consulting explore the intersection of moral-spiritual development and ethical action in the world.  He is bringing the lessons from Changing the World from the Inside Out to change makers and spiritual leaders throughout the country as an educator and consultant with such leading social justice organizations as Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, Keshet and Bend the Arc, and communal and educational institutions as the Hebrew College rabbinical school and Temple Israel of Boston. David is a sought after speaker and travels the country leading scholar-in-residence weekends. He serves as a faculty member at The Mussar Institute and the Institute for Jewish Spirituality retreats.</p>

                <h4 class="ay3">God of War</h4>
                <p class="ay2">“ God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) video game console, and has become a flagship title for the PlayStation brand, consisting of nine fully fledged games across multiple platforms, as well as a text-based game. Based in ancient mythologies, the story follows the titular protagonist, Kratos, a Spartan warrior and later the Greek God of War, who was tricked into killing his family by his former master, the original Greek God of War Ares. This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the different mythological pantheons. The Greek era of the series sees Kratos follow a path of vengeance due to the machinations of the Olympian gods, while the Norse era, which introduces his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist, shows an older Kratos on a path of redemption, which inadvertently brings the two into conflict with the Norse gods and the pair trying to prevent Ragnarök.”</p>
                
                <p class="ay2">Santa Monica has developed all main entries, while Ready at Dawn and Javaground/Sony Online Entertainment-Los Angeles (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) has published all games except the mobile phone installment, which was published by Sony Pictures Digital. The first seven games make up the Greek era of the franchise. God of War (2005), God of War II (2007), and God of War III (2010) comprise its main trilogy; the first two were released on the PS2 with the third on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). A prequel, Ascension (2013), was also released for the PS3. Other games include Chains of Olympus (2008) and Ghost of Sparta (2010) for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and Betrayal (2007) for mobile phones that supported the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME). The Norse era began with the 2018 installment that was also titled God of War and released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and later Windows in January 2022. It was accompanied by a short prequel, A Call from the Wilds (2018), a text-based game through Facebook Messenger. A sequel, Ragnarök, was released in November 2022 on the PS4 and PlayStation 5 (PS5) and concluded the Norse era.</p>
                
                <p class="ay2">Games in the series have been praised as some of the best action games of all time. The series has received numerous awards, including several Game of the Year recognitions for the 2005 and 2018 installments. Some games have also been remastered for newer PlayStation platforms. As of November 2020, the franchise has sold over 51 million games worldwide. Strong sales and support of the series led to the franchise's expansion into other media, such as three comic book series and three novels. A film adaptation of the original installment had been in development but was ultimately canceled; however, a television series adaptation is in development for Amazon Prime Video. Merchandise includes artwork, clothing, toys, and prop replicas, as well as the games' soundtracks, including a heavy metal album, Blood & Metal (2010), featuring original music by various bands who were inspired by the series.</p>
