        <h4>God of War III (2010)</h4>
        <p class="pogi2">God of War III opens on the same moment its predecessor ended. As Kratos and his Titan allies scale Mount Olympus, Poseidon, god of the sea, comes forward to stop them. Kratos kills him with some timely assists from Gaia, flooding all of Greece in the process.
            Then, Zeus steps in. As he casts the invaders off of his mountain, Gaia shows her true colors: Instead of helping Kratos, she lets him fall, calling him a pawn in the Titans' scheme to unseat the gods of Olympus.
            </p>
            
        <p class="pogi2">Abandoned, Kratos once again finds himself weaponless and trapped in the Underworld. There, he meets the spirit of Athena. She's realized she was wrong about Zeus; to save humanity, Kratos must overthrow Olympus. The only way to do that, she says, is to snuff out the Flame of Olympus -- a mystical fire powered by none other than Pandora's Box, which only Pandora herself has the power to retrieve.
            Kratos journeys across the underworld, eventually recovering his lost, god-killing Blade of Olympus and using it to slay Hades. This is only the start of what turns out to be a murderous rampage through the Greek pantheon, Titans and gods alike.
            </p>
            
        <p class="pogi2">Perses, Helios, Hercules, Hermes, Cronos, Hephaestus, and Hera all fall in battle against Kratos. He also maims a wounded Gaia, severing her arm during his second ascent of Olympus and sending her plummeting into the sea.
            Finally, after many battles, Kratos reaches the Flame of Olympus with Pandora in tow. Zeus tries to stop them, but he's too late; Pandora quenches the Flame, sacrificing herself in the process.
            </p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">The final showdown starts out as a three-way battle, with Zeus and Kratos trading blows while a still-injured Gaia reappears and tries to kill them both. Kratos first destroys the Titan and then, with help from the spirit of Pandora as well as those of his dead wife and child, Zeus himself.
            In the game's final moments, Kratos has one, final encounter with the spirit of Athena. She reveals that his original act of opening Pandora's Box to defeat Ares released an evil that infected all the other gods. She commands him to return the power he'd taken, so she can rebuild everything.
            </p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">Kratos, now mistrustful of all gods, refuses and stabs himself with the Blade of Olympus. Doing so releases his power, restoring Greece -- which became increasingly devastated as each god was murdered -- in the process.
            Athena retrieves the blade and departs, leaving Kratos to die. Of course, that doesn't happen. A post-credits scene suggests as much, and now, the new God of War is here to show us all where he went next.
