        <h4>God of War Ragnarök</h4>
        <p class="pogi2">Main Story:
            In Midgard, three years after Fimbulwinter began, as Kratos and Atreus were returning home after a hunt, they were attacked by Freya, who then failed to kill Kratos. When the duo reach their home, Fenrir, one of their wolves, is close to dying; Atreus recites a funerary chant before asking his father to let him grieve for and bury the wolf. Kratos accepts and falls asleep at the house.
            Kratos dreams about Faye but is awoken by Mimir, who is worried since Atreus hasn't returned home from burying Fenrir. While searching for the teen, Kratos and Mimir are attacked by a bear named Bjorn. Kratos strangles the bear until it shape-shifts back to Atreus, who suddenly developed his bear powers from his strong emotions. Atreus and Kratos argue about the former's intent to learn more his "Loki" identity before returning home again.
            </p>
            
        <p class="pogi2">While both father and son were asleep, they were awoken by Thor, the thunder god, who asks to talk with Kratos. Odin, the chief god of Asgard, follows soon after, and makes an offer to the God of War: in exchange for him and Atreus not antagonizing the Aesir gods, Odin and Thor would also not do the same, in order to maintain peace. After they reveal that Atreus has been secretly searching for Tyr, the apparently dead war god, and after Mimir chastises Odin, Kratos coldly refuses the deal. Odin allows Thor to assault Kratos as retribution for killing Baldur, Magni, and Modi. Kratos dies from head traume but is revived by Thor, who wasn't permitted to exterminate the Ghost of Sparta. A stalemate follows soon after, with a gravely injured God of Thunder claiming "[I'll] be seeing 'ya."
            Brok and Sindri encounters a wounded Kratos, who asks them for help going back to his home since Odin is still with Atreus and Mimir. Deducing that Kratos' magical protection stave is broken, Brok offers him, his son, and the head refuge in Sindri's house. Returning home, Kratos is relieved to find Atreus safe, but is angered by how the boy hid the fact that he was researching on Tyr and Loki on his own. However, seeing that this path helps in ensuring safety for Atreus, Kratos accompanies him to Skoll and Hati's Jotunn mural, which actually has a secret room inside that reveals the real fate of the two Giant wolves. The mural and Atreus' secret explorations hint in Kratos, him, and Mimir having to go to Svartalfheim, the realm of the Dwarves, to free Tyr, who is potentially still alive.
            </p>
            
        <p class="pogi2">After Sindri leads the trio to his home in the Realm Between Realms, he, Brok, and Mimir modifies their travel door as a new (and only way) of realm travel. The Huldra Brothers, after learning of the trio's plans to explore Svartalfheim to find and free Tyr, suggests that they go to Nidavellr, the realm's capital city, to find a government official and ex-rebel Durlin. In the Dwarf realm, after Durlin finds out that his former disgraced comrade and Kratos' wife, Faye, has already passed away, he secretly gives Atreus directions to the Jarnsmida Pitmines to find Tyr. Tyr turns out to be alive, and but has developed poor mental health and has made a vow against violence after years of torture. After Kratos yells at him to join the group, Tyr tags along, not as a soldier but at least as someone with information. They all return to Sindri's house.
            Kratos and Mimir lament about how times were simpler in the past and how finding Tyr might have been a mistake from Atreus. Atreus and Sindri sneaks away from them to go to Midgard in order to try recruiting Freya, despite the latter's protests. Atreus consults Jormungandr first on advice for averting Ragnarok, and is disappointed that the only reply he got is to go to "Ironwood", which is potentially not a real place. Atreus meets Freya and reveals to her that he might be the last Giant left, and that Odin breifly visited Midgard. Freya refuses to tag along, and warns Atreus to never approach her again. While they go home, Sindri comforts Atreus and opens up about how Brok had actually died and Sindri partially resurrected him. They both promise to eventually be more honest to Brok and Kratos.
            
            </p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">Kratos, Mimir, and Tyr planned to visit Alfheim in order to see what secrets Groa's Jotunn srine may unlock there. Atreus tags along and they face off against the Light Elves, who took control of the Light of Alfheim and its temple. Upon reaching Groa's shrine, it is revealed to an amused trio and a shocked Tyr that Groa, the sorceress, lied about the Ragnarok prophecy to Odin; instead of all nine realms being destroyed together, a "Champion" will unite the realms against Asgard and only the Aesir realm will be destroyed through warfare. Tyr is dismayed by the revelation and they return home.
            Tyr convinces Atreus that maybe he is the "Champion" of the Jotnar, irritating Kratos. Seeing that his father doesn't look forward to Atreus being this war hero, he retreats to his new room and suddenly wakes up in Ironwood, which is in Jotunheim. He is approached by Angrboda, a Jotunn his age who is aware of her fate with Loki, who shows him around another side of the Giant realm. Eventually, Atreus finds out that his father has a death prophecy, that almost all the Jotnar's souls are placed in marbles so Odin wouldn't find them, and that Gryla, Angrboda's grandmother, has been consuming animal souls for her pleasure. Atreus and Angrboda revive a large soulless snake by imbuing it with a Jotunn named "Jormungandr". The snake leaves with a word. The teen duo then fight Gryla, who taunts Angrboda for her prophecy with Loki, and how he would care more about Farbauti's (Kratos' Norse name) death than her. For the safety of the Jotnar race, Angrboda tells Atreus not to say anything about his trip to Ironwood.
            </p>
        
        <p class="pogi2">Angrboda helps Atreus return home, but he is mistakenly sent to his own house in Midgard. A worried Kratos finds him and questions why he has been missing for two days. Their tense reunion is cut short by the Valkyrie Vanadis, who attacks them. When she gets the upper hand, she reveals herself to be Freya in battle armor. Atreus tries to save his father from her, but he instead stops him from attacking Freya, who demands a temporary collaboration with Kratos and Mimir in Vanaheim so that she should be free from Odin's curse. Brok tags along to meet up with an old friend of his. The Dwarf is trapped though by Freyr, the god of peace and Freya's brother. Freya tells him that they are her allies, and he quickly stops being hostile to Brok, Kratos, and Mimir. Brok stays in Freyr's camp to meet up with another Dwarf, Lunda.
            The Ghost of Sparta and Freya find the source of her curse, which is guarded by the multi-dimensional dragon Nidhogg. Freya decapitates her and finally frees herself from being restricted to travel the realms. When Kratos asks what will happen next between them, she says that while she'll always be at Kratos for killing Baldur, claiming retribution by defeating Odin is more important. They reconcile and become allies. She returns to Freyr's camp soon after and reconciles with his brother too.
            </p>

            <p class="pogi2">Back at Sindri's home, Kratos continues to demand the truth from Atreus, who has already considered going to Asgard as a spy against Odin. Mimir, Freya, Tyr, Brok, and Sindri all discourage him from going to Odin, but he runs away. He finds a neglected Chaurli in Midgard, makes sure he's still alive, and enters the house underneath him, where Huginn is watching. He takes Atreus to Asgard, who encounters a Midgardian refugee, Skjoldr, and the watchman god, Heimdall. Skeptical, Heimdall attacks Atreus until Odin and Thor intervenes. Odin shows him around Asgard and offers Modi's room for him. He then asks for his help to translate foreign text from a mysterious mask, which may hold a vast array of knowledge. After Atreus reads, Odin deduces the mystery and send him and Thor to Muspellheim to find another fragment of the mask.
                Atreus convinces a salty Thor to explore Surtr's Trials while he sneaks to find the secret prophecy behind Surtr's Jotunn mural. Angrboda appears, hints in the fire giant still being alive, and they discover together that actually, Surtr can only destroy Asgard if he combines with his lover, Sinmara. Atreus returns to Thor and manages to get the mask piece. The two return to Asgard.
                </p>

            <p class="pogi2">Back in the Realm Between Realms, Kratos plans to consult the fates of Norse mythology, The Norns. With Mimir and Freya, they travel to Midgard, where the Norns toy with them before allowing the trio to consult them. In the Well of Urd, the Norns reveal that 1) Kratos will eventually die, 2) there is no predetermined fate for everyone, and that all prophecies are predictions based on people's identities and actions, and 3) Heimdall plans to kill Atreus. Kratos, Mimir, and Freya are all perturbed by their words, but Kratos is only concerned about how to defend his son. And he can only do so by planning to kill Heimdall.
After telling the Huldra Brothers of their trip to the Norns, Brok suggests that in order to overwhelm Heimdall's prediction ability, the duplicating ring Draupnir will have to be modified into a spear that detonates its duplicates on command. Kratos, Mimir, Freya, and Brok head to Svartalfheim to meet the only entity capable of forging the Draupnir Spear: the Lady of the Forge. However, while the Spear was forged, Brok realizes that the Lady doesn't see her because his restored soul is incomplete. He figures out and is enraged to know that he actually died, but Kratos consoles him. Odin visits the God of War in the Dwarf realm just to insult him. As Kratos returns to Sindri's house, he dreams of another memory of Faye, this time with an infant Atreus. Kratos remains haunted by his dreams of the past.
</p>
            <p class="pogi2">Back in Asgard, Atreus and Thrud, Thor's daughter, is summoned by Odin. The Allfather confesses that his whole plan all along is to use the mask to uncover where will he go when he dies. He then sends the two of them, plus Heimdall, to Helheim. Heimdall leaves them behind for another mission from Odin. Atreus and Thrud find a giant wolf and releases it, believing it to be unjustly held captive. Heimdall however scolds them for it, revealing that they had just released Garm, a Hel-hound that starts tearing through the fabric of reality. Atreus asks Odin to send him back to Midgard, and the latter sadly does his request.
                Atreus returns to Sindri's house, which is terrorized by Hel-walkers due to a rift made by Garm. After Freya and Atreus seal it back, he reunites with Kratos. Ratatoskr grants travel access to Kratos and Atreus to Helheim. They hunt down Garm and break it's neck, but Garm is immedietly ressurected, as the giant Hel-Hound has no soul for them to kill. Atreus realizes that Fenrir's soul is contained in his knife due to his funerary chant at the start of the game, and with Kratos' help, Fenrir's soul is transfered to Garm's body. Kratos, realizing what has happened, commands Fenrir to return to Midgard. The father and son starts opening up about their own secrets, like Kratos' Draupnir Spear and Atreus' journey to Ironwood, and they fully reconcile before retuning home.
                
                </p>
            <p class="pogi2">Kratos, Mimir, and Atreus travel to Vanaheim soon after to aid Freyr and Freya. Firstly, they searched for Skoll and Hati, who are missing, and Atreus signals them to turn day back into night so that everyone can tell time again. Secondly, Kratos and Mimir face Heimdall, who does not accept being granted mercy by the God of War. Kratos brutally kills him, much to Mimir's horror, and they save Freyr, who is injured and ambushed by the Einherjar. Kratos takes Heimdall's horn, Gjallarhorn, and the rebels escapes through riding Skidbladnir, and Byggir leaves them to save the group from dragons.
                Atreus tells the group back home about Odin's mask and plans to return to Asgard to gather more information. Kratos reluctantly accepts. In Asgard, Atreus corrects his translation, and this time, instead of Helheim, the last mask fragment is actually in Niflheim. With Thrud's help, Atreus finds Thor in a mead hall, and the latter starts a bar fight. Thrud chastises Thor for relapsing back into alcoholism, and Atreus and Thor travel to the mist realm.
                
                </p>
                <p class="pogi2">On their journey, Thor begins to bond with Atreus, but stops once his wife, Sif, warns him that Atreus, who is responsible for Modi's demise, could end up being involved with Thrud's death too. Atreus, with a completed mask, evades Thor with Sindri's help. Atreus returns home and shows the mask to everyone inside Sindri's house. Tyr proclaims that he will take them to Asgard to dight Odin, using the mask as leverage, but Brok is suspicious of his plan since never once did he say that he had a way to Asgard this whole time. Annoyed, Tyr stabs Brok and is revealed to be Odin. He escapes, declaring war on Kratos. A dying Brok forgives Sindri for lying about his death, and the latter teleports a dead Brok away from the Realm Between Realms.
                    Kratos and Atreus goes their real home to grieve, and Kratos and Mimir gently tells Atreus to confront his mistakes instead running away from them. They meet up with an angry Sindri in his and Brok's former forge, and the Dwarf ends his friendship with Atreus. The trio return to Freya, who plans to mobilize the realms against Asgard. Kratos and Atreus (Mimir too, but Hildisvini takes him to Helheim to communicate with Hraesvelgr) are tasked with finding Surtr in Muspellheim, who refuses to join their forces if it means sacrificing Sinmara too in the process. However, upon seeing that Kratos' Blades of Chaos are made of primordial fire, he joins them and fuses with the Blades' fire instead of his lover.
                    </p>
                <p class="pogi2">The father-son duo reunites with Freya in Midgard to talk about their success. Freya then tells them that the last part of their plan is to appoint a general to lead them against Ragnarok. She asks that Kratos considers the role, and he goes to his tent to rest. The Ghost of Sparta dreams of Faye yet again, who is, this time, preparing for her eventual death early on. Kratos does hot panic from the dream this time, and he accepts Freya's suggestion that he would be general of the realms. In Tyr's Temple, he and Freya deliver an impassioned speech before blowing Gjallarhorn, granting all the realms access to Asgard. Asgard's forces attempt to sever their link to other realms to thin out Kratos' forces, and Atreus and Sindri opens a secret passage in Asgard's wall. Thrud attempts to kill Atreus, but is stopped by Sif and Skjoldr, who figures out that Odin is disinterested in saving his own people. Entering Asgard's city, Thor fights the younger Yormungandr and with a powerful hit, sends him back in time, just before he fights Kratos. Kratos wins, shows mercy, and convinces Thor to fight for Odin. Odin arrives at the scene quickly, and kills Thor for changing sides, just before hitting Thrud with Mjolnir. Kratos, Mimir, Atreus, and then with Freya face off against the Allfather. Atreus destroys his mask mid-battle, and drags his soul to Loki's marble, which was given by Angrboda. An enraged Sindri smashes the marble, effectively killing Odin, and Surtr, now named RAGNAROK, prepares to incinerate the realm. Angrboda and Fenrir, who has Garm's powers, help Kratos and co. escape. Freyr sacrifices himself to ensure that Freya would reach Fenrir's rift in time. Asgard is destroyed.</p>
                <p class="pogi2">Atreus, unconscious, wakes up and sends his goodbyes to the remaining survivors. He reunites with Kratos and Angrboda, who takes them into one last secret Jotunn shrine: Faye's. Atreus confesses that he has to travel alone from now on in order to find the rest of the Jotnar, and a saddened Kratos supports his decision. Atreus and Angrboda departs. Kratos finds out that there is another shrine behind Faye's: his very own. He is destined to eventually become the beloved Allfather of the realms. Shocked by this revelation, he invites Mimir and Freya to help him rebuild the realms post-Ragnarok. They both accept the offer, and the adventures of Kratos, Mimir, and Freya continue.  </p>
